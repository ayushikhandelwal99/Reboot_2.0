## Problem Block System call :
    - block system call for date command
    - that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept
    - do the same Firefox as well

### Solution-->
    - Don't know yet (searched but can't find)
    - we can do this by passing date and firefox in bash condition for check 
    - if command is date or firefox then it will run `test $command`
    - in this way kernal only gonna test those commands but not execute
